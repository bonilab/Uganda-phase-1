# Model Description

The Malaria Simulation, or MaSim, is a stochastic, [individually-based model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) (or individually-based micro simulation) designed to investigate the evolution of antimalarial resistance by the *[Plasmodium falciparum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum)* in the presence of an antimalarial therapy given to a symptomatic individual, with transmission driven by a force of infection model. The simulation may be run as either a regionally-based model or a geographically-based model. While both approaches include the same levels of population heterogeneity, when run as a regionally-based model spatial heterogeneity (i.e., varying prevalence and transmission intensity) is limited whereas the geographically-based model allows for heterogeneity to be modeled at the configuration resolution of the simulation (e.g., 25 km^2^).

## Individuals

All individuals within the simulation represent humans that may become infected by the *P. falciparum* parasite, which leads to either a symptomatic or asymptotic infection. In the event of a symptomatic infection, individuals will seek treatment at the configured rate and will receive a therapy based upon the configuration provided to the simulation. Upon taking a therapy, a simplified pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) is used to determine the blood concentration of the drug(s) in blood. The blood concentration, combined with the drug resistance profile for the *P. falciparum* clone(s) determines the killing rate of the parasite and reduction of blood parasitemia. 

## Infection

While *P. falciparum* is transmitted by female *Anopheles* mosquitoes, as a modeling simplification a force of infection (FOI) model is used that presumes that transmission is driven in part by the total parasite load of all individuals within a given area. The likelihood that an individual is bitten is then determined by their individual biting attractiveness and a seasonal adjustment to account for the variable number of mosquitoes present throughout the year. All bites are presumed to be infectious and the probability of infection is determined by the individual's underlying immune response to *P. falciparum*. 

### Infection Life Cycle

The infection life cycle for an individual begins when they are selected by the simulation to be "bitten" by an infectious mosquito. This triggers a sporozite challenge in the individual in which the infection proceeds to based upon the following equation [@zupko_long_term_2022]:

$$
Pr_{inf}= \left\{
\begin{matrix}
Pr & \text{if } \theta < 0.2 \\
0.1 & \text{if } \theta > 0.8 \\
Pr\left ( 1 - \frac{\theta - 0.2}{0.6} + 0.1 \frac{\theta - 0.2}{0.6} \right ) & \text{otherwise}
\end{matrix}\right.
$$

Where *Pr* is the probability of infection for an immunological na√Øve individual, $\theta$ is the individual's current immunity, and *Pr~inf~* is the final probability of infection. Upon failing the challenge the individual's state is set to `exposed`, the infection then proceeds to the liver stage, and seven days later, the blood stage. Upon entering the blood stage the individual's state is set to `asymptomatic`, the parasitemia is set to a random value within the asymptomatic bounds. Next, the individual is checked to see if they have an effective drug in their blood^[This can occur if they are treating a recent infection, participated in a mass drug administration campaign, or are taking seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis.], if they do then the infection will remain asymptomatic, otherwise it may progress to a clinical infection.

The probability that an asymptomatic infection will progress to clinical is dependent upon the individual immune response [@nguyen_optimum_2015]:

$$Pr_{clin}= \frac{0.999}{1 + \left( \frac{\theta}{\theta_{mid}} \right) ^z}$$
Where $\theta_{mid}$ is the configured midpoint infliction of the immunity curve, and *Pr~clin~* is the final probability of a clinical infection. In the event that the individual proceeds to a clinical infection, then after the appropriate number of days for their age, the clinical infection manifests. At this point the individual's state is set to `clinical` and the parasitemia is increased to be within the clinical bounds. While the simulation assumes that all clinical infections manifest with recognizable symptoms, treatment seeking may not always occur. As a result, following progressing to clinical, the individual then decides to seek treatment with a probability that is appropriate for their current location and their age group.^[In other words, the probability of seeking treatment is determined by the location that the individual is currently in, not their original location or intended destination.] 

When an individual seeks treatment, the simulation first checks to ensure that it will prevent death. If the treatment is insufficient, then the individual state is set to `dead` and the death is processed by the simulation. Otherwise, a series of events are scheduled wherein the individual may take the prescribed therapy each day, and parasites are cleared from the blood based upon the current immune response and level of drugs in the blood. During this time, the individual's state may progress from `clinical` to `asymptomatic` based upon the parasitemia. Once the individual has completed the course of treatment, if there are still parasites present in the blood, then the individual is checked to see if they will relapse based upon the configured value. Otherwise, they continue to clear the parasite based upon their immunity clearance rate. Once the parasite is cleared, and if there are no other clones present, the individual state will be restored to `susceptible`.

In the event that the individual does not seek treatment, the checks to see if the infection will result in death. If so then the individual state is set to `dead` and the death is processed by the simulation. Otherwise, the individual slowly clears the infection via their immunity clearance rate which will progress them from `clinical` to `asymptomatic` to `susceptible`.

In areas with a high prevalence, multiple infections with different clones is possible and the progression is the same as described in this section for each clone. In the event that multiple clones are present in the blood, then the killing rate is calculated for each of the clones based upon the drugs efficacy upon that clone.

## *P. falciparum* Genotypes

Upon model initialization, the circulating genotypes of *P. falciparum* is determined by the configuration; however, when mutations are enabled, there is a small probability of a mutation occurring. While this mutation may confer an evolutionary advantage (e.g., resistance to an antimalarial), if accompanied by a fitness cost, the mutation may be lost or out competed by wild-type parasites without the mutation. Also included in the model is recombination due to interrupted feeding by a mosquito resulting in multiple clones being present in the gut. The probability for this occurring is based upon the configuration provided and the FOI of the circulating genotypes.

## Policy Interventions

Within the simulation, drug policy interventions (e.g., a change in first-line therapies) are supported with limited support for non-therapeutic interventions (e.g., bed net distribution). Due to the lack of an underlying vector model, interventions targeting the *Anopheles* mosquitoes are not supported.
